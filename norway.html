        <h1>Crossing The Norwegian Moutains</h1>
        <p>After eight years of dreaming and more than four years of planning, I finally embarked on my grand journey: crossing the Norwegian mountains on foot. Admittedly, I didn’t traverse all of the Norwegian mountains — an endeavor that might take several years to complete — but I did manage to cross most of the central region. Over the course of 50 days, I hiked and stayed in 40 different DNT huts, covering a total of 550 kilometers. I started at Haukeliseter in the southern central mountains and concluded with the Fjordruta hike near Trondheim.<br><br>This experience only made me realize how much more there is to explore in those mountains, prompting me to begin planning my next trip. Follow the links below for a brief summary of the hike.</p>
