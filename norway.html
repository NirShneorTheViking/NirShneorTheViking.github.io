    <h1>Crossing The Norwegian Moutains</h1>
    <p>After 8 years of dreaming of it and more then 4 years of planning - I went on my grand journey - crossing the Norwegian mountains by foot. True - I didn't cross all of the Norwegian mountains, this might take few years to accomplish - but I did (almost) cross the central area: Hiking for 50 days, sleeping in 40 different DNT huts with traveling total of 550 km - starting in Haukeliseter in the south central mountains and finishing with the Fjordruta hike almost by Trondheim. To tell the truth - this only made me understand how much more there is to hike and see in those mountains. So I had to start planning my next trip. Here is a short summery of the hike. I will try to elaborate more about each part in the future.</p>
