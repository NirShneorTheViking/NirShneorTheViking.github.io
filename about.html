            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I’ve loved nature and hiking for as long as I can remember. It’s a part of our family culture—hiking every weekend is a tradition. While living abroad in the USA and later in the Netherlands, my family and I hiked and traveled extensively. Growing up, I joined a hiking group in Israel and later began my world travels, exploring New Zealand, Australia, Nepal, and my favorite place on earth: Norway. I’m passionate about hiking and traveling, and I start planning my next trip as soon as I return from one.<br><br>My grand tour of the Norwegian mountains was planned over a period of four years, or even longer, since my first visit to Norway when I was 16. If you need assistance planning your next trip or tips for hiking and traveling in Norway, Europe, or elsewhere, I’m always happy to help.</p>
