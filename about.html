            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I've loved nature and hiking since I can remember my self. It's part of our family's culture - hiking every weekend is a must. Living abroad in the USA, and later on in The Netherlands, we hiked and travelled a lot as a family. Growing up I joined a hiking group in Israel, and later on started my world-touring with New Zealand, Australia, Nepal, and my favorite place on earth - Norway. I love hiking and traveling, and planning the next trip - is something I start as soon as I am back from one. My grand-tour of the Norwegian mountains was planned over a period of 4 years - or even more, since my first visit to the Norwegian mountains when I turned 16. Need a hand in planning your next trip or some tips for hiking/traveling in Norway, Europe or elsewhere?  I am always keen to help.</p>
